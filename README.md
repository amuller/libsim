libsim
======

Libsim is a dictionary of similarity (distance) functions. 

This is an effort sponsored by simMachines, and through the
Propymes Grant FP-034-12 from the Costa Rican Ministry of
Science and Technology and CONICIT (National Council for Scientific and Technological Research).  


Encyclopedia of Distances
======

We have translated to code many distance functions from the Encyclopedia of Distances.

A quote from Dr. Michel Deza (author of the Encyclopedia of Distances)

 Distance metrics and distances have now become an essential tool in many areas of Mathematics and its applications including Geometry, Probability, Statistics, Coding/Graph Theory, Clustering, Data Analysis, Pattern Recognition, Networks, Engineering, Computer Graphics/Vision, Astronomy, Cosmology, Molecular Biology, and many other areas of science. Given the importance of similarity measures, I welcome the effort that simMachines has initiated with the open source "libsim" library. By providing open source distance functions, the barrier of entry to implement similarity applications becomes lower.  "
