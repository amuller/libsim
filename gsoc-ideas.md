Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2014
======

Libsim is a dictionary of similarity (distance) functions. 

This is an effort supported by simMachines, and through the
Propymes Grant FP-034-12 from the Costa Rican Ministry of
Science and Technology and CONICIT (Costa Rican National Council for Scientific and Technological Research).  

Some of the ideas that we propose: 

* Add new distance functions using the Encyclopedia of distance functions by Desa et al. 
* Improve test cases 
* Add a new algorithm to OBSearch.net, improve packaging and distribution. 
* Add new automatic distance learning techniques to the library.

Dr. Michel Deza is the first author of the Encyclopedia of Distances, a volume dedicated to enumerating and listing distance functions.  
This is what Dr. Michel Deza said about our library: 


" Distance metrics and distances have now become an essential tool in many areas of Mathematics and its applications including Geometry, Probability, Statistics, Coding/Graph Theory, Clustering, Data Analysis, Pattern Recognition, Networks, Engineering, Computer Graphics/Vision, Astronomy, Cosmology, Molecular Biology, and many other areas of science. Given the importance of similarity measures, I welcome the effort that simMachines has initiated with the open source "libsim" library. By providing open source distance functions, the barrier of entry to implement similarity applications becomes lower. "
