Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2014
======

Libsim is a dictionary of similarity (distance) functions. 

This is an effort sponsored by simMachines, and through the
Propymes Grant FP-034-12 from the Costa Rican Ministry of
Science and Technology and CONICIT (National Council for Scientific and Technological Research).  

Some of the ideas that we propose: 

* Add new distance functions using the Encyclopedia of distance functions by Desa et al. 
* Improve test cases 
* Add a new algorithm to OBSearch.net, improve packaging and distribution. 
* Add a new distance learning technique.
